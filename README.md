## GEDICorrect: A Python Framework for GEDI Geolocation Correction at the Orbit, Beam or Footprint-Level Using Multiple Criteria and Parallel Processing Methods

An open-source Python framework for precise GEDI geolocation correction using small-footprint ALS data, designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind. GEDICorrect integrates multiple methods, criteria, and metrics, including waveform matching, terrain matching, and relative height (RH) profile matching, to achieve refined geolocation accuracy at the orbit, beam, or footprint levels. By leveraging advanced similarity metrics - such as Pearson and Spearman waveform correlations, Curve Root Sum Squared Differential Area (CRSSDA), and Kullback-Leibler divergence - GEDICorrect ensures precise alignment between GEDI measurements and simulated data.

Additionally, GEDICorrect incorporates parallel processing strategies using Python’s multiprocessing capabilities, enabling efficient handling of large-scale GEDI and ALS datasets. This scalability makes the framework practical for global-scale applications while maintaining accuracy and computational efficiency. This framework works as an extension to ![GEDI Simulator](https://bitbucket.org/StevenHancock/gedisimulator/src/master/), developed by Steven Hancock and the GEDI Science Team, which we are thankful for their valuable contributions. More specifically, GEDICorrect uses the _gediRat_ and _gediMetrics_ programs from GEDI Simulator to simulate GEDI footprints using the ALS data, and extract metrics from those footprints.

By addressing critical barriers in geolocation correction with an open-source, user-friendly design, this framework enables a better assessment of canopy structure that can be applied to a wide range of fields, from advancing our understanding of carbon sequestration to supporting more informed planning and conservation efforts.

## Installation

**Requirements**:
- GCC: 11.4 or later (to install ![GEDI Simulator](https://bitbucket.org/StevenHancock/gedisimulator/src/master/))
- Python: 3.11 or later
- Anaconda: 23.11.0 or 24.4.0 or later
- OS: Linux or Windows WSL (Ubuntu)

**Installation Steps**:

Always keep a copy of the most recent update of GEDICorrect, to ensure it functionality.

_________________________________

For Windows Users:
- GEDICorrect Support for Windows (natively) is currently unsupported, however, it provides Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in the most recent versions of Windows (10 or 11). Before installing GEDICorrect, it is recommended that you install the ![Ubuntu WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). After following the instructions, start your Ubuntu subsystem and follow the subsequent steps inside the virtual machine.

_________________________________

To install GEDICorrect:

1. Clone the repository. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
2. Execute the Bash script `install_hancock_tools.bash` located in the root directory of the repository. This script will install GEDI Simulator and all the necessary dependencies to perform GEDI waveform simulations. To execute it, first give it executable permissions with `chmod +x install_hancock_tools.bash` and then execute it with `./install_hancock_tools`.
3. After installing GEDI Simulator, setup the Anaconda virtual environment (must have ![Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install) installed first) for this repository by installing its required dependencies using the provided `environment.yml` with `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
4. Activate the virtual environment with `conda activate GEDICorrect`. You're set up!

## Getting Started

**Data Requirements**:

![](https://github.com/leonelluiscorado/GEDICorrect/blob/main/readme/AlignL1BL2A.drawio.png)<br/>

GEDICorrect requires two set of data to correct GEDI footprints: ALS flight and intersecting GEDI orbits on a Study Area. ALS must be provided in `.las` files. For GEDI, only L1B and L2A data products are currently supported, and GEDICorrect only accepts **merged** L1B-L2A data products. A merge script (recommended) is available at `utils/align_l1b_l2a.py`. Please follow the instructions provided with:
`python3 align_l1b_l2a.py --help`.

**Running GEDICorrect**:

To execute the framework, simply follow the instructions provided in the `gedi_correct.py` script by running this command: `python3 gedi_correct.py --help`. The user must always specify:
- _.las_ files directory
- **Merged** GEDI files directory
- An output directory where to save the corrected files.

**Examples**:

Switch the file directories provided in the examples with your desired directories, inside quotation marks ("").

```
python3 gedi_correct.py --las_dir "/home/leonel/abrantes_studyarea" --granules_dir "/home/leonel/gedi_merged_abrantes" --out_dir "/home/leonel/abrantes_correct"
```
Executes GEDICorrect with default footprint correction settings: at the orbit-level using Pearson's Correlation metric.
______________
```
python3 gedi_correct.py --las_dir "/home/leonel/abrantes_studyarea" --granules_dir "/home/leonel/gedi_merged_abrantes" --out_dir "/home/leonel/abrantes_correct" --mode "beam" --criteria "wave_pearson kl"
```
Executes GEDICorrect on a study area at the Beam-level, using the Pearson Correlation and KL metrics on the waveforms to calculate the similarities.
______________
```
python3 gedi_correct.py --las_dir "/home/leonel/abrantes_studyarea" --granules_dir "/home/leonel/gedi_merged_abrantes" --out_dir "/home/leonel/abrantes_correct" --mode "footprint" --time_window 0.04 --criteria "rh_distance" --parallel --n_processes 8
```
Executes GEDICorrect at the Footprint-level, using the CRSSDA on the RH profile similarity metric with a time window of 0.04. This command also lets GEDICorrect run in parallel, using 8 processes to process GEDI data.

For more information on commands and options, please use
```
python3 gedi_correct.py --help
```
